## Overview
### Description
Fitti is a social app that allows users to leave posts in the real world. Users can post at their current location, and other users can view posts made around them. Fitti builds connections and organizes content that is relevant to users as they travel, and it promotes real-time and asynchronous communication about the world.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Fitti is built for those on the go. The mobile GPS is one of the core features of the app. Also, users can use their camera to quickly post pictures of anything they see around them.
- **Story:** This app adds a fun new layer to everyday life. Users can check posts at any location to find fun new content that is directly connected to their surroundings. Landmarks can become hubs of activity, and users are motivated to post because of this visibility.
- **Market:** This app targets average social media users. It has familiar features such as posting and feeds. Anyone who goes outside can benefit from this app.
- **Habit:** Users would be motivated to check Fitti at any new location they went to. Going to a new landmark would be a chance to discover new, interesting content. Users would also want to make posts when they encountered something relevant to the location.
- **Scope:** The core requirements around this app, in addition to basic login features, are GPS/Maps integration, and post uploading/viewing. After this, there are several places to expand, including live feeds, commenting, user profiles, and post leaderboards.
